## Processing

Processing is a programming language created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, who were artists/collaborators at the MIT Media Lab. Their intention was to teach the basics of programming to artists and creatives in a visual context. In Processing, one uses code to create graphic designs.

## Ways People Are Using Processing\*

\*and derivatives of Processing such as p5.js

(Digital Fabrication) [Laser Cut Record](https://amandaghassaei.com/projects/laser_cut_record/) Amanda Ghassaei created Laser Cut Record as a more accessible way to fabricate records. She uses a Processing program that takes an audio waveform and maps it onto a spiral on the records surface which cause the needle to vibrate back and forth to produce variations in sounds.

### Should artists learn to code?

Coding is a creative activity, an extension of design. Code is not just execution. Design does not end when execution starts. Learning to design and learning to code will allow one to drive changes.
