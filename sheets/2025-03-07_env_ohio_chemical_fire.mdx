# Ohio Chemical Fire

### effective strategies in dealing with chemical spills

- Strong warning systems, consistent communication from public officials
- Guidance on indoor air quality and well water quality testing
- Official warnings and guidance to help residents make informed decisions for protective action. These responses were quick and spontaneous in the case of the Ohio chemical fire incident.
- Finanical assistance for residents needing to relocate.

### concerns for long term impacts

- Dioxins in bloodstream.
- Concerning levels of vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate not present in air and water tests.
- Despite reassurance from EPA, residents remained concerned because they could smell the chemicals officials were saying weren't at toxic levels.
- Visible sediment and chemical sheen on creeks contradicted what people were being told. Understandable mistrust in offical messaging.
