# Clock

A split-flap display that counts time nonuniformly, varying based on human influence by detection of motion or speech.

The clock is a machine with strict rules that dictates human behavior. For a long time, clocks have held a public importance and, in many contexts, impose a sense of stress and urgency accepted by society without question. This project proposes an alternative clock that doesnâ€™t count time linearly but instead allows for natural variation influenced by human interaction.

The display itself will based on the open source project [scottbez1/splitflap](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap). Most materials are readily available through the FabLab and personal inventory, but the control board and assosciated components will need to be purchased. Fabricating would be possible but impractical given time and resource constraints. The flaps will be recycled PVC cards cut to size. I will probably source these from the community (FPF?) and cut them to size. Depending on how difficult cutting them by hand turns out to be, I would consider stacking them and making a fixture to cut them on the waterjet or if it's possible, milling them on the CNC.
