# Nuclear

Igini, Martina. (Jan 28, 2023). [The Advantages and Disadvantages of Nuclear Energy](https://earth.org/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-nuclear-energy/) Earth.org

Nuclear energy can be extracted from an atomâ€™s nucleus to produce electricity in a reactor through an atomic reaction. Nuclear energy offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels but comes with risks such as proliferation of nuclear weapons and pollution from radioactive nuclear waste. Nuclear power plants come at a high upfront cost, but they are reliable for electricity generation and can help reduce emissions as shown by countries like France, Canada, and others. Critics of nuclear energy bring up concerns about nuclear disasters, proper storage of radioactive waste, and geopolitical conflicts.

## Is nuclear worth the risk?

One major concern about nuclear energy is managing hazardous nuclear waste. If not properly managed, it could pose significant risks to human and environmental health. This could be effectively managed using policy to standardize waste management protocols and enforce guidelines. Governments can also implement financial incentives to subsidize long-term storage facilities to manage nuclear waste. With this concern in mind, the risk of nuclear disaster would be fairly low compared to the current environmental and human health risks of pollution from fossil fuels.
